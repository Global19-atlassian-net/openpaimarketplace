# Pytorch DDP Example With Apex

  This example shows how to train a custom neural network on cifar10 with Pytorch on OpenPAI.

  We installed Apex before running `python <script.py>`,we recommend using the right network interface, so we used environment variables, and the sample program will be trained on two machines, each with two gpus.

  If youâ€™re using the Gloo backend, you can specify multiple interfaces by separating them by a comma, like this: . The backend will dispatch operations in a round-robin fashion across these interfaces.And mixed precision training (training in a combination of float (FP32) and half (FP16) precision) allows us to use larger batch sizes and take advantage of NVIDIA Tensor Cores for faster computation.
